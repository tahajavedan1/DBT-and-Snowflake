# DBT-and-Snowflake
Project Description:

## Models:
Create Models which are SQL logics, essentially sets of SQL queries and transformations that you create using the dbt run command.

## Materializations:
There are four main types of materializations:
Table:
This type is like creating a permanent table to store your data. It's useful for data you want to keep for a long time.
View:
Views provide a dynamic window into your data without actually storing it separately. They help you visualize your data in different ways.
Incremental:
Incremental materializations update your data in a way that only the new or changed data is processed, saving time and resources. It's like updating a document with only the latest changes.
Ephemeral:
Ephemeral materializations are temporary and used for interim steps in data processing. They're like quick notes you jot down temporarily.

## Seeds:
Seeds are like the starting point for your data journey. They often contain static data, such as information from a CSV file. Seeds are your project's foundation, providing initial data to build upon.

##Sources:
Sources are where you obtain your data. They can be databases, files, or other data repositories. Think of them as the places you go to collect the raw materials for your project.

## Snapshots for SCD Type 2:
Snapshots help you track changes in your data over time, particularly when dealing with Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) of Type 2. They enable you to maintain historical records of data changes.

## Writing Generic and Singular Tests:
Testing involves checking the accuracy and reliability of your data and processes. Generic tests are like overall health checkups, while singular tests are specific checks on individual pieces of data.

## Dbutils and Surrogate Key:
Downloading packages, such as "dbutils," is like adding useful toolkits to your toolbox. These packages contain pre-built functions and utilities to make your work easier. Additionally, a surrogate key is a unique identifier assigned to each item in your data. It's like giving every item a special ID number so you can easily track and manage them.

## Analyses and Hooks:
Analyses help you gain insights from your data, while hooks are like connectors that link your work to other parts of the process, ensuring smooth data flow.

## Exposures:
Exposures are like sharing your work with others. They allow people to see and interact with the results and insights you've generated.
